# Accessibility - How to skip repetitive navigation links


<p>This example illustrates how to implement the possibility to skip repetitive navigation links on a page according to the Section 508 (§1194.22 (o)) guidelines. The "Skip to main content" link will appear at the top of a web page when the <strong>Tab </strong>is pressed just after the web page is loaded. To show or hide this link, the toogle() method is used. Click on this link moves the focus to the main content. The navigation url is specified in the href attribute of the link's <a> tag. </p>
